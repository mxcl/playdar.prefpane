playdar.prefPane
================
A Mac OS X Preference Pane for the Playdar music content resolving daemon.

http://www.playdar.org

The prefPane wraps the daemon completely, with built in Sparkle auto-updates,
so you can just get on with resolving content and not worry about the inner
bits.

Fork It!
